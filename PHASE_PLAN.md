# IMPLEMENTATION PHASE PLAN — AADAP

## Phase List

1. Core Infrastructure
2. Orchestration Engine
3. Agent Framework
4. Agent Implementations
5. Safety & Approval System
6. Memory Integration
7. End-to-End Integration & UI
8. Testing & Hardening (Deferred)
9. Production Readiness (Deferred)

## Phase Principles
- Phases must execute sequentially
- Exit criteria must be met before advancing
- No phase may modify previous phase modules

## Deferred Phases
Phases 8 and 9 are explicitly deferred and must not be partially implemented earlier.
